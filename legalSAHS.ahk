::dissolutionOfNikah::
(
decreed ex-parte in the following manner:
1.	Plaintiffs sought dissolution of marriage, on the basis of cruelty and desertion from her house by defendant. As per section 2 (ii) of the Dissolution of Marriage Act 1939, when a husband has neglected or failed to provide her for maintenance, she is held entitled for dissolution of her marriage. Therefore, the marriage of the plaintiff and defendant are stand dissolved and a copy of this judgement shall be sent to the concerned union council who shall send a copy of this judgement to the defendant and if the defendant failed to appear within 90 days of the notice, then the marriage between plaintiff and defendant shall stand dissolved and defendant is held liable to pay Rs.30,000/- as iddat maintenance to the plaintiff.
2.	There is nothing in rebuttal for the dower, hence, it is held that the dower of the plaintiff is 4 tola gold, which defendant is bound to pay to the plaintiff on her demand.
3.	Plaintiff maintenance allowance is fixed @Rs.5,000/- per month from institution of the suit till her iddat period and @Rs.3000/- per month for plaintiff No.2 till her Nikah. Needless to mention here that this maintenance allowance is an addition to the maintenance allowance during the period of iddat.
4.	Plaintiff is entitled for the return of her dowry articles, if the dowry articles were not found at the resident of defendant then she is held entitled for the market value as per the list and assessment made there in.

::rejectionOfPlaint::
(
the scope of the rejection of plaint is not limited rather the Hon’ble superior courts have time and again held that to adjudicate the matter involved in a law suit for rejection of plaint, the court can consider the available record for deciding the fate of the plaint while considering and construing the record tentatively.
	In a recent reported judgment addressing the necessity of invoking the jurisdiction of the court of law for rejection of a plaint, the Hon’ble Peshawar High Court, Peshawar, in the case reported as 2022 CLC 873, has held as follows:
	“Though ordinarily, intricate question of law and facts cannot be resolved without recording of evidence but when a fact has already been established and resolved cannot be agitated on the basis of the same cause of action which has already been alleged and decided by the courts to its logical conclusion, the institution of the fresh suit on the basis of same cause of action and trial of suit later on would be nothing but a futile exercise.”
	In this judgment while explaining the necessity and scope of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC, it has been held as follow:
	“It is by now a settled law that incompetent, illegal and vexatious and frivolous suit must be buried at its inception, as the birth of those suit would not only prolong the agonies of the parties but wastage of precious time of the court as well. Fruitless and useless litigation must not be encouraged.”
